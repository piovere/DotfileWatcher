# DotfileWatcher

You can download a compiled version from [the releases page](https://github.com/sjml/DotfileWatcher/releases/).

Watches `~/.dotfiles` and pops a tiny icon in the status bar if anything's changed
that hasn't been committed to git. When the icon is clicked, it opens `~/.dotfiles`
in Visual Studio Code for inspection. 

Throw it in Login Items and let it do it's thing. 

Could be set up to be more configurable, but it does what I need.
